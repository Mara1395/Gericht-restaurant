## Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:

    <li>React Functional components and their reusability</li>
    <li>React file and folder structure</li>
    <li>Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  -&nbsp; 
  -&nbsp; Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
  -&nbsp; From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
  -&nbsp; Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
  -&nbsp; And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
