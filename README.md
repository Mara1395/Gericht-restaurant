## Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

<h3>Through this project I learned:</h3>
  -&nbsp; React Functional components and their reusability
  
  -&nbsp; React file and folder structure
  
  -&nbsp; Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
  -&nbsp; Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
  -&nbsp; From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
  -&nbsp; Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
  -&nbsp; And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
