## Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

Through this project I learned:
  1. React Functional components and their reusability
  
  2.React file and folder structure
  
  3.Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
  -Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
  -From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
  +Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
  -And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
