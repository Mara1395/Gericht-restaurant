## Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:
* React Functional components and their reusability
* React file and folder structure
* Fundamental CSS properties (flex & grid)
* Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
* From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
