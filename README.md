This is a modern restaurant website built according to a template in figma design. This page was created using react js and tailwind css.

## Introduction

In order to further improve myself in React, I follow Adrian Hajdin's YouTube tutorials. Some of my repositories will be projects that I created according to the tutorial.

### Through this project I learned:
  <ul>
    <li>React Functional components and their reusability</li>
    <li>React file and folder structure</li>
    <li>Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid</li>
    <li>Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model</li>
    <li>From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients</li>
    <li>Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices</li>
    <li>And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.</li>
  </ul>
